      my name is Fadia. I'm a software engineer and originally from Iraq.
      I live in Canada since 2013 and the reason that I came to Canada because my husband got a schoolarship to continue his PHD in civil engineering here in Ottawa at Ottawa University. I'm a mom of three boys. 
    </p>
    <p> after a a long carrier journy as a software engineer, I chose <b><abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr></b> because I'm eager to learn some skills in design, especially in web design and mobile interface design. As a learner, My main gaol is  to use my skills in coding and design to help people with learning disabilities to use technology  resources through creating a special user interface that would be
         accordant with their needs. I’m still working in establishing this goal as it’s demands a lot of hard work and creative achievements.</p>
  <p>I’m really optimistic about this field of study. Because exploring new things and gaining more skills should has no limits or boundaries.
  Regarding to hobbies, I like to read about everything. beside that I might sometimes: </p>
